<p><a href="{{ data['uri'] }}">Provide consent</a> for your gabbering
to be made public for others to listen to. You can listen back to the
gabbering, and if you decide you don't want to share the audio, there's an
option to anonymize the audio content (we will transcribe it for you). That
way, your gabberings are still public, but not associated with you. </p>
