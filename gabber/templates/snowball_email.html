<p>Thanks for providing consent to the gabber you created.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, why not <a href="https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/dokku/gabber/download">download gabber</a> to
record gabberings around "experience of volunteering" with your friends?</p>

<p>We know this takes time and effort, so we are providing reimbursements (Amazon vouchers) for your time using Gabber, which include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>£1 for reach gabber you record</li>
  <li>50p for reach gabber your friend records</li>
  <li>25p for each gabber your friends friend records</li>
</ol>

<p>You can receive reimbursements to a maximum of £10 per day until the study
is complete or our threshold in the study has been met -- we will email you
when this happens.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> consent by both (yourself and the friend(s) ) e provided to receive reimbursement,
and gabbers created must be from unique friends and last at least a few minutes.</p>
